# <Horisean Marketing Agency>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was my motivation?
    Refactoring the starter code to meet web accessibility standards and to follow the Scout Rule (leaving the code a little clear than I found it), through integrating semantic HTML and simplified CSS rules.
- Why did I build this project? 
    I built this project for a marketing agency to create a codebased that follows accessibility standards so that the agency's site is optimized for search engines.
- What problem does it solve?
    The site allows the Horisean marketing agency to advertise their services and makes gaining information about the agency's services accessible to potentional customers.
- What did you learn?
I learned that it is imperative to understand how to place semantic HTML elements, simplify the classes and ids in my HTML, and ensure that the CSS rules are consolidated and target the correct elements, classes, and ids. I learned that properly distinguishing when to use <article>, <section>, and <div> makes HTML more meaningful to a developer and makes it easier to simplify classes and CSS rules. Also, I learned that commenting on my code is very helpful for visualizing how my code is organized.
